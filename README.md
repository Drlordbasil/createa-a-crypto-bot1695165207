## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/crypto-bot.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd crypto-bot`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To start using the Crypto Bot, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   import time
   import random
   import pandas as pd
   ```

2. Define your trading strategy:

   ```python
   # Choose a technical indicator
   indicator = MovingAverage(20)

   # Choose a trading strategy based on the indicator
   strategy = RandomStrategy(indicator)
   ```

3. Create an instance of the TradingBot and pass the strategy:

   ```python
   bot = TradingBot(strategy)
   ```

4. Start the bot:

   ```python
   bot.start()
   ```

   The bot will continuously analyze market data, apply the chosen strategy, and execute buy/sell orders accordingly.

## Trading Strategies

The Crypto Bot supports multiple trading strategies:

1. RandomStrategy: Randomly generates buy/sell signals based on market data.
2. TrendFollowingStrategy: Applies a trend-following strategy to make trading decisions.
3. MeanReversionStrategy: Applies a mean-reversion strategy to make trading decisions.
4. BreakoutStrategy: Applies a breakout strategy to make trading decisions.

To create a custom strategy, inherit from the Strategy base class and implement the `execute_strategy` method.

## Technical Indicators

The Crypto Bot provides several technical indicators to analyze market data:

1. MovingAverage: Calculates the moving average values.
2. ExponentialMovingAverage: Calculates the exponential moving average values.
3. RSI: Calculates the Relative Strength Index values.
4. MACD: Calculates the Moving Average Convergence Divergence values.
5. BollingerBands: Calculates the Bollinger Bands values.

To create a custom technical indicator, inherit from the TechnicalIndicator base class and implement the `calculate` method.

## Portfolio Management

The Crypto Bot includes a Portfolio class for managing holdings and cash. It provides the following functionality:

- Buying and selling assets
- Updating portfolio holdings based on market data
- Calculating portfolio performance

To use the Portfolio class, create an instance of it and use the `buy` and `sell` methods to execute trades. The `update_holdings` method should be called periodically to keep the portfolio up to date.

## Backtesting

The Crypto Bot includes a Backtest class for simulating trading strategies using historical market data. It allows traders to evaluate the performance of their strategies without risking real money.

To perform a backtest, create an instance of the Backtest class and provide the trading bot, start date, and end date. Then, call the `run` method to start the simulation.
